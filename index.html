<h1>First steps with git</h1>
<>
  <li>
    <h2>Get Started with Bash in Windows</h2>
    <p>
      Press Windows key + X then click Command prompt, at the command prompt,
      type: bash then hit Enter. If you want to be able to access the local file
      system, press Windows key + X, Command Prompt (Admin) then type
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>change directories</h2>
    <p>
      For example, on a Unix based system, if you wanted to have your repository
      in your Documents folder, you change directories as follows: cd Documents
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>copies your repository from GitHub to your local computer</h2>
    <p>
      Once you have navigated to the directory where you want to put your
      repository, you can use:git clone https://github.com/URL-TO-REPO-HERE
      (clone your newly created repository from GitHub to your local computer.
      From your repository page on GitHub, click the green button labeled Clone
      or download, and in the “Clone with HTTPs” section, copy the URL for your
      repository.)
    </p>
    <p>
      When you run git clone repo-path-here, You should see output like: Cloning
      into 'test-repo'... remote: Counting objects: 5, done. remote: Compressing
      objects: 100% (4/4), done. remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0),
      pack-reused 0 Unpacking objects: 100% (5/5), done. Checking
      connectivity... done.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>To verify that your repository now exists locally</h2>
    <p>
      To verify that your repository now exists locally, type ls in your
      terminal. The ls command lists the files & folders available in your
      current directory. You should see a directory with the same name as the
      repository that you created previously on GitHub.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Tracking changes with git add and git commit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>see all of the files that exist in your GitHub repository:</h3>
        <p>
          If you list all the files in this directory (using ls la), you should
          see all of the files that exist in your GitHub repository: ls -a .git
          .gitignore LICENSE README.md Alternatively, we can view the local
          repository in the finder (Mac), a Windows Explorer (Windows) window,
          or GUI file browser (Linux). Simply open your file browser and
          navigate to the new local repo. Important Tip The .git element is
          listed when you use the ls -a command shows up is actually a directory
          which will keep track of your changes (the commits that you make) in
          git. Warning: Do not edit the files in this directory manually!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Edit a file in your repo</h3>
        <p>
          Once you are happy with your changes and have saved them, go back to
          your terminal window and type git status and hit return to execute the
          command.
        </p>
        <h3>git status</h3>
        <p>
            On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

      <li>
        <h3>Add and commit changes  </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Add files</h4>
                <p>You can add an individual file or groups of files to git tracking. To add a single file, use

git add file-name-here-with-extension</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Commit files
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Once you are ready to make a snapshot of the current state of your repository, you can use git commit. The git commit command requires a commit message that describes the snapshot / changes that you made in that commit.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>git log</h4>
                <p>
                    After you’ve made a few commits, check out the output of the git log command. You should see the history of your repository, including all of the commit messages!
                </p>
